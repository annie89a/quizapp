# quizapp
A monolithic application where user will be able to perform CRUD operations on questions. 
So user will be able to :
i) view all questions
ii) view all questions by category
iii) add question
iv) update question
v) delete question

So with questions, quizes will be created where we will be able to:
i) create quizes
   - we specify the category of the question, for example Week 10
   - we can also specify the number of questions and title of the quiz
   - upon successful quiz generation, a quiz id will be automatically generated
ii) get quiz by ID
   - we can get the quiz by ID
iii) We can also calculate the result of the quiz upon completing the quiz,
    i.e. after answering the quiz questions
